        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
        Our research focuses on developing efficient, adaptable, and scalable AI systems through innovative co-design approaches across three key areas:
        </p>

        <h3>Efficient AI Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
        <!-- Sponge analogy: Similar to how a sponge squeezes out redundancy, we extract unnecessary computation -->
        We develop AI algorithms that optimize computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, much like how a sponge can squeeze out redundancy. Recent exemplary work includes <a href="https://licj15.github.io/MixRT" target="_blank" class="link">MixRT (3DV’24)</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=IVqzbuLfoL" target="_blank" class="link">Fragment-Pruning (NeurIPS’24)</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Adaptive AI Hardware Architectures</h3>
        <p>
        <!-- Sponge analogy: Like how a sponge changes shape to fit its environment -->
        We design hardware architectures that dynamically adapt to diverse AI workloads and deployment scenarios, similar to how a sponge can mold itself into different forms. Recent exemplary work includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23644" target="_blank" class="link">Uni-Render (HPCA’25)</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10764505" target="_blank" class="link">Fusion3D (MICRO’24, Best Paper Award)</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Scalable AI Infrastructure and Systems</h3>
        <p>
        <!-- Sponge analogy: Like a sponge expanding to absorb more -->
        We build scalable systems and infrastructure that enable efficient training and deployment of AI applications across scales, from edge devices to large-scale data centers, much like how a sponge can expand to absorb more. Recent exemplary work includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08112" target="_blank" class="link">Scale-GNN (DAC’25)</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=_0kaDkv3dVf" target="_blank" class="link">HW-NAS-Bench (ICLR’21, Spotlight)</a>.
