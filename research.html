      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Our research focuses on developing efficient, adaptable, and scalable AI systems through innovative co-design approaches across three key areas:
      </p>
      
      <h3>Efficient AI Algorithms</h3>
      <p>
        We develop novel algorithms that optimize computational efficiency while maintaining high performance. Our work includes sparse neural networks, quantization techniques, and adaptive learning algorithms.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Adaptive AI Hardware Architectures</h3>
      <p>
        We design hardware architectures that can dynamically adapt to different workloads and applications, including reconfigurable computing platforms and domain-specific accelerators.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Scalable AI Infrastructure and Systems</h3>
      <p>
        We build scalable systems and infrastructure that enable efficient deployment and management of AI applications across different scales, from edge devices to large-scale data centers.
